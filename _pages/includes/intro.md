I am currently a Research Fellow at NTU, working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pONu-5EAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. XiaoFeng Wang</a> and <a href="https://weidong.hk/">Prof. Wei Dong</a>. In 2024, I completed my Ph.D. with honor at the Zhejiang University, co-supervised by Prof. Wenyuan Xu, Prof. Xiaoyu Ji, and Prof. Chen Yan. Previously, I obtained my B.Eng with honor also from Zhejiang University in 2019.

My research is broadly in the fields of (1) AI security and privacy, with a special focus on the security and privacy issues associated with multimodal AI, and (2) AI for system security, particularly for addressing vulnerabilities in critical IoT, communication, and software systems.

In AI-oriented contexts, I focus on developing trustworthy intelligent audio and vision models, safeguarding user privacy, and fortifying generative models against various leaks and attacks. I also regulate AI behavior to ensure alignment with societal responsibilities, especially in the context of large language models such as Stable Diffusion and GPT-4.

In system-oriented contexts, I work toward developing dependable and secure machine learning (ML) systems and am committed to their application for deployment in critical infrastructures and consumer electronics, e.g., in the domain of audio/vision-interface IoT devices, carrier networks, and software systems.
